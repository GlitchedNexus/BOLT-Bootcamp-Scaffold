    "# Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "EDA is the process of analyzing and visualizing the data to understand its structure, patterns, and relationships. It is an important step in the data science process as it helps to identify any issues with the data and to gain insights that can inform the modeling process. It is by far the most important step in the data science process, as it helps to understand the data and to identify any issues with the data. It also helps to gain insights that can inform the modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For EDA, you can use various techniques such as descriptive statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis. Descriptive statistics can help to summarize the data and to identify any outliers or anomalies in the data. Data visualization can help to visualize the data and to identify any patterns or relationships in the data. Correlation analysis can help to identify any relationships between the features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing EDA, it is important to keep in mind the following:\n",
    "- Always start with a clear question or hypothesis in mind. This will help to guide your analysis and to focus on the most relevant aspects of the data.\n",
    "- Be open to discovering new insights and patterns in the data. EDA is not just about confirming your hypotheses, but also about discovering new insights and patterns in the data.\n",
    "- Use a variety of techniques to analyze the data. Different techniques can provide different insights and perspectives on the data, so it is important to use a variety of techniques to analyze the data.\n",
    "- Always be mindful of the limitations of your data and your analysis. EDA is not a perfect process, and there are always limitations to the data and the analysis. It is important to be mindful of these limitations and to interpret the results of your analysis with caution.\n",
    "- Finally, remember that EDA is an iterative process. You may need to go back and forth between different techniques and analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the data and to uncover new insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, we want you to figure things out on your own, we will only introduce some elementary techniques for EDA. You are encouraged to explore more advanced techniques on your own."

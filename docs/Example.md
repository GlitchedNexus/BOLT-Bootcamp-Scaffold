# Why should you document your code?
Documentation is an essential part of software development. It helps other developers understand your code, its purpose, 
and how to use it. Good documentation can save time and reduce frustration for both the original developer and anyone 
who may need to work with the code in the future. It also makes life easier for recruiters who may be evaluating your work. 

By providing clear and concise documentation, you can demonstrate your professionalism and attention to detail, which 
can make a positive impression on potential employers. Additionally, well-documented code can help you maintain and 
update your projects more efficiently, as it serves as a reference for yourself and others.

So, whether you're working on a personal project or contributing to an open-source library, taking the time to document 
your code can have significant benefits for you and those who may use or collaborate on your work in the future.
